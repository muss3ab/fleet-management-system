## How the Booking System Works

### Route-based Booking

The system supports booking between any two cities on a route. For example, for a route `Cairo → AlFayyum → AlMinya → Asyut`, users can book:

-   Cairo to AlFayyum
-   Cairo to AlMinya
-   Cairo to Asyut
-   AlFayyum to AlMinya
-   AlFayyum to Asyut
-   AlMinya to Asyut

### Seat Availability Logic

The system prevents overbooking by checking route overlaps:

-   If a seat is booked from Cairo to AlMinya, it cannot be booked for Cairo to AlFayyum (overlap)
-   But it can be booked for AlMinya to Asyut (no overlap)

### Pricing

Prices are calculated based on distance (number of cities between start and end points) multiplied by the base price.

## Administration

### Creating Trip Schedules

Use the artisan command to create new trip schedules:

```bash
php artisan trip:create-schedule {trip_id} {travel_date} {bus_id}
```

Example:

```bash
php artisan trip:create-schedule 1 2025-07-15 1
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
php artisan test
```

## Database Seeding

The system includes seeders for:

-   Egyptian cities (Cairo, Giza, AlFayyum, AlMinya, Asyut, Sohag, Luxor, Aswan)
-   Sample buses with 12 seats each
-   Sample trips with multi-city routes

Run seeders:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

## Architecture Highlights

### Service Layer

-   **BookingService**: Handles complex booking logic and seat availability
-   Separation of concerns between controllers and business logic
-   Transaction support for data consistency

### Database Design

-   Normalized structure with proper foreign keys
-   JSON field for flexible route storage
-   Unique constraints to prevent duplicate bookings

### Security

-   Laravel Sanctum for API authentication
-   Request validation with custom form requests
-   SQL injection prevention with Eloquent ORM

### Performance

-   Efficient queries with proper relationships
-   Database indexing on frequently queried fields
-   Optimized seat availability checking
